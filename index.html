    <h1>
        this is a web page made with just html
    </h1>
    <h4>
        Q. what is html?
    </h4>
    <h3> 
        A. well, it stands for <em>hypertext markup language</em> and it used to create all of the content on a webpage.
    </h3>

    <h4>
       Q. What do I mean by content?
    </h4>
    <h3> 
       A. I'll show you. Check out the <em>unorganized list</em> (this just means all the items in the list aren't numbered
        ) below of some examples.
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            all of the <strong>text</strong> you see on a web page is written in an html document        
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>images</strong>, like this one:
            <p><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1108099/pexels-photo-1108099.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=1&w=500" alt="doggos" width="200">
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1CPE6WWsAQ">
                link to some good vibes
            </a>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
        Q. in addition to writing text, it appears you can also change the way it looks in html...how do you do this?    
    </h4>
    <h3>
        
        A. to change the size of the text, use the heading elements. Each of them is displayed in the <em>organized list</em> below. There are other ways to change the size of your text if you are building a website but doing it this way lets the browser that opens the web page know which text is the most important (1 most important-6 least important):        
    </h3>
   
    <ol>
        <li><h1>here is the h1 element</h1></li>
        <li><h2>here is the h2 element</h2></li>
        <li><h3>here is the h3 element</h3></li>
        <li><h4>here is the h4 element</h4></li>
        <li><h5>here is the h5 element</h5></li>
        <li><h6>here is the h6 element</h6></li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        You can also make text <strong>bold</strong> or <em>italicized</em> with html. 
    </p>
    <h4>
        Q. what if I want to make a web page with a cool background and a dropdown menu and other stuff that actually makes it look like all of the other sites I see on the web?
    </h4>
    <h3>
        A. this, for the most part, is beyond the scope of html. If you wanna make your web page look cool, you will need to learn CSS (cascading style sheets) and if you want your web page to do cool stuff, you will need to learn JavaScript.
    </h3>
    <p>
        That's it for this web page. I will post the same page modified with CSS soon. After that I will add some JavaScript, as well. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Have a great day!
